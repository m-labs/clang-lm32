<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
AddressSanitizer is a fast memory error detector.
It consists of a compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library.
The tool can detect the following types of bugs:
<ul> <li> Out-of-bounds accesses to  <ul><li>heap <li>stack <li>globals</ul>
  <li> Use-after-free
  <li> Use-after-return (to some extent)
  <li> Double-free
</ul>
Typical slowdown introduced by AddressSanitizer is <b>2x</b>.

<h2 id="intro">Usage</h2>
In order to use AddressSanitizer simply compile and link your program with
<tt>-faddress-sanitizer</tt> flag.
To get a reasonable performance add <tt>-O1</tt> or higher.
If a bug is detected, the program will print an error message and exit with a
non-zero exit code.

<h3 id="has_feature">__has_feature(address_sanitizer)</h3>
In some cases one may need to execute different code depending on whether
AddressSanitizer is enabled.
<a href="LanguageExtensions.html#__has_feature_extension">__has_feature</a>
can be used for this purpose.
<pre>
#if defined(__has_feature) && __has_feature(address_sanitizer)
  code that runs only under AddressSanitizer
#else
  code that does not run under AddressSanitizer
#endif
</pre>

<h2 id="platforms">Supported Platforms</h2>
AddressSanitizer is supported on the following platforms:
<ul> <li>Linux <ul> <li> i386 <li> x86_64 <li> ARM </ul>
     <li>Darwin <ul> <li> i386 <li> x86_64 </ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li> AddressSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run.
  How much -- depends on the allocations sizes. The smaller the
  allocations you make the bigger the overhead.
  <li> On 64-bit platforms AddressSanitizer maps (but not reserves)
  16+ Terabytes of virtual address space.
  This means that tools like <tt>ulimit</tt> may not work as usually expected.
  <li> Static linking is not supported.
</ul>


<h2 id="status">Current Status</h2>
AddressSanitizer is work-in-progress and is not yet fully functional in the LLVM/Clang head.
For the up-to-date usable version and full documentation refer to
